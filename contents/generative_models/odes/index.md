# ODEs

Ordinary differential equations as a framework for probability transport.

- [Continuity Equation](continuity_equation) — ODE definition and the PDE constraint relating density evolution to vector field
- [Distribution Transformation](distribution_transformation) — how ODEs transport any $p_0 \to p_1$ via conditional and marginal vector fields
- [Inversion](inversion) — the reverse ODE: negating and time-flipping the forward drift
